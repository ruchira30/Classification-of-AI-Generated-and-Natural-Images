# Deepfake Detection: AI-Generated vs. Natural Image Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify AI-generated images and natural images, aimed at detecting deepfakes. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras Sequential API.

## Key Features
- **Model Architecture:** CNN model designed to distinguish between AI-generated and natural images.
- **Datasets:**
  - Pygoogle dataset with 1000 images.
  - Self-made dataset with fewer images.
- **Performance:**
  - Achieved 88% accuracy on the Pygoogle dataset.
  - Achieved 81% accuracy on the self-made dataset.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance visualized using a confusion matrix to analyze and understand misclassifications.
